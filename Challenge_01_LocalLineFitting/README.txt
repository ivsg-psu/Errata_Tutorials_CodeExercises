For your first code challenge, here is a set of MATLAB codes that perform a line fit of data. Your task is to study this, learn how it works, and then create a repository in GitHub to start working on this as a project. For your project, you will write a NEW function: fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_local_N_points. Your function should allow the user to input an integer start_index (say 24) and a number of points M (say 17), and the function will then give the slope/intercept from point 24 out to a total of 17 points, so that it is doing a LOCAL line fit, not global fitting. In other words, if someone gives you data that has 20,000 points and you only want a line fit around point 223 using only this point and the 16 points thereafter (for a total of 17 points), you would call this function with start_index = 226 and M = 17. Once you get your code working, I want you to create some test cases - just like you see me do in the script that is attached - that show the results of the line fitting. Make sure to choose complicated situations as we'll be using your code for the next code challenge which is going to be more difficult. One suggestion is to using lots of plotting of your resulting line fits on top of your data to show how these line fits change as you move through the data.
