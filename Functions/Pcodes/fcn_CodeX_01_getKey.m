% FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY - generate student and computer-specific key
%    
%    Welcome to FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY . In this assignment, you are asked to
%    write code that queries this function, FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY, with a key code
%    input and your student number. The solution is literally one line of
%    code that requests a code key (a strange set of characters) from the
%    function.
% 
%    For example, to solve this, one could type in their script or at the
%    MATLAB prompt:
%  
%             entry_key = ' 234ADH&45'; % <--- this must be changed
%             student_number = 1234; % <--- this must be changed                      
%             answer = fcn_CodeX_01_getKey(entry_key,student_number);
%             fcn_GradeCodeX('fcn_CodeX_01_getKey',answer);
% 
%    This assignment asks students to write their own script for these
%    lines of code. And yes, it is as easy as copy/paste into a script, and
%    editing the lines indicated.
% 
%    To check if the answer is correct, the above lines call fcn_GradeCode. 
% 
%    If the answer is right, the Grader function gives the next problem. If
%    it is wrong, it gives an error and perhaps a hint to help you. May this
%    message be enough to get you started on your code journey - the first
%    step is always the hardest!
