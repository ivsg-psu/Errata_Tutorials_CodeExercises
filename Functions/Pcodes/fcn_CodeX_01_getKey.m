% FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY - generate student and computer-specific key
%    
%    Welcome to FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY . In this assignment, you are asked to
%    write code that queries this function, FCN_CODEX_01_GETKEY, with no
%    arguments or inputs. The solution is literally one line of code that
%    requests a code key (a strange set of characters) from the function.
%    For example, to query a function called "fcn_be_happy" that produces a
%    result "a", you would type in their script or at the MATLAB prompt:
% 
%                       a = fcn_be_happy;
% 
%    This assignment asks students to write their own line of code for this
%    function. And yes, it is stupidly easy.
% 
%    To check if the answer is correct, call fcn_GradeCode. For example, if
%    you stored the result as "a" like in the example above, you would call:
% 
%    right_or_wrong = fcn_GradeCodeX(a);
% 
%    If you are right, the grader prints information and gives you the next
%    problem. If you are wrong, it gives a red text that says you are wrong
%    and perhaps a hint to help you. May this message be enough to get you
%    started on your code journey - the first step is always the hardest!
