% FCN_CODEX_07_THATSODD - find odd numbers
%    
%    Welcome to FCN_CODEX_07_THATSODD . In this assignment, the goal is to
%    identify which numbers in a list are odd.
%  
%    Specifically: this function produces a vector of 10,000 integers as a N
%    x 1 matrix. The solution is an N x 1 matrix that is 1 if the
%    corresponding integer is odd, 0 if it is even.
%  
%    For example, say we call the function:
% 
%    some_odd_numbers =
%    fcn_CodeX_07_thatsOdd(entry_key,student_number,guess);,
% 
%    and it produces the following: (only showing the first five entries)
% 
%    some_odd_numbers =
%  
%      11
%      2
%      8
%      3
%      5 
%     (etc)
%     
%    The correct answer would be:
% 
%      1
%      0
%      0
%      1
%      1 
%     (etc)
% 
%    As in all the assignments, to check if the answer is correct, call
%    fcn_GradeCode and pass in the function name, student number, and answer.
% 
%    fcn_GradeCodeX('fcn_CodeX_07_thatsOdd',student_number, answer_07);
% 
%    If the answer is right, the grader prints information and gives the
%    entry code for the next problem. And if wrong, it indicates it is
%    wrong.
