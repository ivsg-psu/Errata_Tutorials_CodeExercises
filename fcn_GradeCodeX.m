function fcn_GradeCodeX(varargin)
%FCN_GRADECODEX     grades problems for the CodeX challenges. 
%   
%   FCN_GRADECODEX with no input arguments with no inputs automatically
%   builds a Utilities directory by downloading problems from the internet.
%   It also sets up the work environment.
%
%   [RIGHT_OR_WRONG, NEXT_FUNCTIONS, NEXT_KEYS] = ...
%   FCN_GRADECODEX(FUNCTION_NAME,ANSWER_TO_CHECK) will query a function
%   given by a string in FUNCTION_NAME, checking to see if ANSWER_TO_CHECK
%   is the correct answer. If the answer is correct, then RIGHT_OR_WRONG is
%   set to true, and NEXT_FUNCTIONS lists a cell array of strings of the
%   next problems that can be done. Another cell array, NEXT_KEYS, lists
%   the "entry keys" for each of the next problems, listed in the same
%   ordering as NEXT_FUNCTIONS.
%
%   If the answer is wrong, RIGHT_OR_WRONG is set to false and the cell
%   arrays are empty.
%
%   FORMAT:
%
%        [RIGHT_OR_WRONG, NEXT_FUNCTIONS, NEXT_KEYS] = ...
%           FCN_GRADECODEX(FUNCTION_NAME,ANSWER_TO_CHECK)
%
%   INPUTS:
%
%        FUNCTION_NAME: A character array for the title of the functions to
%        be solved. 
%
%        ANSWER_TO_CHECK: The student's answer to check.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%
%        RIGHT_OR_WRONG: a true or false value, true if correct
%
%        NEXT_FUNCTIONS: a cell array of filenames that can be opened with
%        the given keys.
%
%        NEXT_KEYS: the keys for each of the filenames.
%
%   DEPENDENCIES:
%
%        This code will automatically get dependent files from the internet,
%        which requires an internet connection during the first instance
%        that it is run. Note: an internet connection is not needed after
%        the first run.
%
%   EXAMPLES:
%
%       See the script: script_demo_CodeX.m to get started.  To get
%       started, just call the function, fcn_GradeCodeX, with no arguments.

function fcn_INTERNAL_checkDependencies(dependency_name, dependency_subfolders, dependency_url)
% The code requires several other libraries to work, namely the following
% 
% * DebugTools - the repo can be found at: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools
% 
% Each should be installed in a folder called "Utilities" under the root
% folder. This means you need to create a folder called
%    ./Utilities/DebugTools/ 
% If you wish to put these codes in different directories, the function
% below can be easily modified with strings specifying the different
% location.
% 
% For ease of transfer, zip files of the directories used - without the
% .git repo information, to keep them small - are included in this repo.
% 
% The following code checks to see if the folders flag has been
% initialized, and if not, it checks to see if the directory "Utilities"
% exists, and if not, it creates it. It then checks if "DebugTools" exists,
% and if not, creates it. It then unzips the DebugTools zip file into the
% directory, which puts all the files in the DebugTools code set into this
% directory.
%
% Once the directory and files are ready, it calls the DebugTools function
% that loads the "path" information for MATLAB, namely: where can MATLAB
% find the files in these folders?

% Is the flag set that says that the folders are initialized? Check this
% using a command "exist", which takes a character string (the name inside
% the '' marks, and a type string - in this case 'var') and checks if a
% variable ('var') exists in matlab that has the same name as the string.
% The ~ in front of exist says to do the opposite. So the following command
% basically means: if the variable named 'flag_CodeX_Folders_Initialized'
% does NOT exist in the workspace, run the code in the if statement. If we
% look at the bottom of the if statement, we fill in that variable. That
% way, the next time the code is run - assuming the if statement ran to the
% end - this section of code will NOT be run twice.

% Create a variable name for our flag. Stylistically, global variables are
% usually all caps.
