function fcn_DebugTools_installDependencies(dependency_name, dependency_subfolders, dependency_url)
%% FCN_DEBUGTOOLS_INSTALLDEPENDENCIES - MATLAB package installer from URL
%
% FCN_DEBUGTOOLS_INSTALLDEPENDENCIES installs code packages that are
% specified by a URL pointing to a zip file into a default local subfolder,
% "Utilities", under the root folder. It also adds the package subfoder
% and any specified sub-subfolders to the MATLAB path.
% 
% If the Utilities folder does not exist, it is created.
%
% If the specified code package folder and all subfolders already exist,
% the package is not installed. Otherwise, the folders are created as
% needed, and the package is installed.
%
% If one does not wish to put these codes in different directories, the
% function can be easily modified with strings specifying the
% desired install location.
% 
% For path creation, if the "DebugTools" package is being installed, the
% code installs the package, then shifts temporarily into the package to
% complete the path definitions for MATLAB. If the DebugTools is not
% already installed, an error is thrown as these tools are needed for the
% path creation. 
%
% Finally, the code sets a global flag to indicate that the folders are
% initialized so that, in this session, if the code is called again the
% folders will not be installed.
%
% FORMAT:
%
%      fcn_DebugTools_installDependencies(dependency_name, dependency_subfolders, dependency_url)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      dependency_name: the name given to the subfolder in the Utilities
%      directory for the package install
%
%      dependency_subfolders: in addition to the package subfoder, a list
%      of any specified sub-subfolders to the MATLAB path. Leave blank to
%      add only the package subfolder to the path. See the example below.
%
%      dependency_url: the URL pointing to the code package.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      (none)
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%      This code will automatically get dependent files from the internet,
%      but of course this requires an internet connection. If the
%      DebugTools are being installed, it does not require any other
%      functions. But for other packages, it uses the following from the
%      DebugTools library: fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% % Define the name of subfolder to be created in "Utilities" subfolder
% dependency_name = 'DebugTools_v2023_01_18'; 
%
% % Define sub-subfolders that are in the code package that also need to be
% % added to the MATLAB path after install. Leave empty ({}) to only add 
% % the subfolder path without any sub-subfolder path additions.
% dependency_subfolders = {'Functions','Data'}; 
%
% % Define a universal resource locator (URL) pointing to the zip file to
% % install. For example, here is the zip file location to the Debugtools
% % package on GitHub:
% dependency_url = 'https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools/blob/main/Releases/DebugTools_v2023_01_18.zip?raw=true';
%
% % Call the function to do the install
% fcn_DebugTools_installDependencies(dependency_name, dependency_subfolders, dependency_url)

    % in this case 'var') and checks if a variable ('var') exists in matlab
    % that has the same name as the string. The ~ in front of exist says to
    % do the opposite. So the following command basically means: if the
    % variable named 'flag_CodeX_Folders_Initialized' does NOT exist in the
    % workspace, run the code in the if statement. If we look at the bottom
    % of the if statement, we fill in that variable. That way, the next
    % time the code is run - assuming the if statement ran to the end -
    % this section of code will NOT be run twice.
